'<h3>The Inter-Island Artist Lock-In Project Concept</h3>
<p>The Artist Lock-In is a professionally facilitated residency project that brings Artists of a variety of disciplines, ages, backgrounds and experiences together to learn from each other and respond to their surroundings. Its aim is to provide Artists with time and space to consider new ways of working and collaborate with people of different practices.</p>
<p>Participants spend a fixed period of time (previously it has been a week) in an unusual location and are taken through a series of tasks that encourage teamwork and creative thinking. As the week progresses the tasks become more open, until the participants are left to work together to make shared work that will be showcased to an audience at a set time at the end of the residency.</p>
<p>To mirror the inclusive and cooperative ethos of the Island Games, the JAT is  inviting one Artist from each participating Island to spend 10 days at Elizabeth Castle where they will develop shared work around the theme of ''Islandness''. As an Island off an Island, Elizabeth Castle is the perfect location for such exploration to take place. For up to 12 hours a day it is completely cut off from the mainland of Jersey and contains a myriad of interesting spaces and structures.</p>
<p>Over the course of 8 days the Artists will work together to create a live installation that can then be showcased to the public in 3 ''performances'' over the remaining 2 days. The project will be fully residential with no Artist leaving the Island of Elizabeth Castle at any point in the project – they will truly be ''locked in''.</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to bring people of different cultures, languages, experiences and backgrounds together in a spirit of creativity and cooperation, forming closer ties with our fellow Islands.</p>

<h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>

<h3>Practicalities</h3>
<p>Accommodation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Island Games Artist Lock-In Project will take place at Elizabeth Castle in partnership with Jersey Heritage</li>
<li>In order to accommodate 24 artists, 2 facilitators and 4 runners, the JAT will work with the Territorial Army to set up a base barracks on site for all of the participants to inhabit during the project.</li>
<li>Transport between St. Helier and Elizabeth will be via Jersey Heritage Ferries</li>
<li>Catering will be provided by a private chef</li>
</ul>
<p>Dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Island Games 2015: Saturday 27th June 2015 – Friday 3rd July 2015</li>
<li>Island Games Lock In (including arrival and departure dates): Monday 22nd June 2015 – Thursday 2nd July 2015</li>
<li>Showcase performances on Tuesday 30th June and Wednesday 1st July</li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sue Hill, Associate Director of WildWorks, will facilitate the project with the support of local Producer/ Performer (now working in London) Francesca Duncan.</li>
<li>There will be the opportunity for local students to participate as runners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Artist Lock-In will be open to Artists of all different, backgrounds, disciplines, art forms, ages and experience. We are looking for a complimentary representation of all forms and levels as this will be most conducive to making shared work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Media Potential</h3>
<p>With the experimental and original nature of the concept and diversity of the participants, it is likely that the Artist Lock-In will gather significant press attention, both in Jersey and the other Islands with Artists taking part. Depending on other arts events in the country happening at the time, it may even attract national industry press attention.</p>
<p>There was substantial interest from the press for the much smaller Lock-In at Elizabeth Castle in 2013, including a front page photo in the JEP and a lot of enthusiasm and follow up on the concept.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>At the end of the Artists'' 8 days on Elizabeth Castle their collective work will be open to the public to view. This is likely to initially take place as a collective performance with the Artists and then once they leave, an installation piece that people can view in their own time. At present we would propose to have 3 ''performances'' with one designated for young people and the installation piece to be left for 1 week after the Artists leave.</p>
<p>The entire process can be tracked, blogged, filmed and photographed further expanding the audience and its appeal.</p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Whilst the Artists will not be paid to take part in the Artist Lock-In, the JAT through the help of its crowd-funding campaign, will cover all accommodation, hosting, catering, on-Island transport, materials, tools and facilitation costs.</p>
<p>The competing jurisdictions have been asked to contribute towards the travel expenses of their artist to come to Jersey, ideally covering the entire costs of their flights.</p>

<h3>Past Lock-Ins</h3>
<p>The concept of artist lock-in projects has been developed over the past three years by the JAT with sensational feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Garden 2012  – 7 local and UK participants camped in the gardens of Grey Gables, facilitated by the JAT.</li>
<li>Elizabeth Castle 2013 – 13 international and local participants, facilitated by Sue Hill, Associate Director of WildWorks theatre company.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testimonies from Past Participants</h3>
<blockquote>It was intense and emotional and "play" has never been such hard work, but it was a week that will remain one of the most memorable of my life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I came out of it with a greater confidence to venture out of my comfort zone and trust in my own abilities.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The experience has had a far greater effect on me than I could have ever anticipated.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There was a great dynamic within the group, which formed very quickly. Sue (Hill) was the key to this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Elizabeth Castle is layered historically and geographically with narratives, spaces and frames that provide the perfect environment for engaging the mind, body and soul.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In terms of artist development the lasting impact is almost impossible to quantify but this experience will no doubt inspire our work for years to come. The Jersey Arts Trust has also managed to bring together people who want to work in smaller collaborations in the future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>...the attitude that nothing could count as failure, sparked creativity beyond measure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>With a project like this, I was able to network with international artists and local artists alike on Jersey soil, which has undoubtedly re-cemented a connection with the Island and opened the doors to collaborating with these fellow artists on future projects that can only fuel the Island''s artistic worth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Jersey is so lucky to have an organisation like the Arts Trust who supports artists and provides platforms for discussion and debate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Please do more! I''m certainly always interested!</blockquote>

<h3>About The Jersey Arts Trust</h3>
<p>The remit of the Jersey Arts Trust (JAT) is to develop the arts in Jersey. Along with a small grants scheme and a programme of initiatives designed to support the local arts community, JAT has in recent years built a reputation for large-scale development projects that encourage the creation of new work by local and international Artists. Programmes such as the Spearpoint New Plays Project, Skipton Open Studios, Bedell Creative Arts Programme, Artist Residencies and Artist Lock In have all provided a professionally facilitated framework for Artists at all levels of ability, backgrounds and disciplines to develop their craft and create exciting new work.</p>
<p>This has stimulated the local audience with fresh Island voices, which has sparked positive attention from the local press and enabled JAT to form partnerships with dynamic companies in France, Finland and the UK. Increasingly, JAT has worked to consider Jersey within a broader International context, opening its opportunities up to participants from all over the world, enabling a much broader scope of people to benefit from Jersey''s unique creative offering.</p>
