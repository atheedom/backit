'<p>In 2002 the Jersey Sports Association for the Disabled approached St Pauls FC with a view to providing coaching to a group of seven individuals with learning disabilities. Those original seven ranged in age and ability and despite these variances, the group bonded and encouraged each other, developing an ethos of fun and sportsmanship. Over the years the squad has grown and now numbers 24 members between the age of 18 to 58 and includes three ladies, who have a variety of learning disabilities including Downs’ Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy and head injuries.</p>
<p>The squad trains every Tuesday evening all year around, either at St Pauls ground or by moving indoors during the winter months. A training session usually consists of a warm-up, skills exercises and a game of football all of which keeps the individuals fitter, improves co-ordination and behaviour and develops teamwork. Every third Saturday the squad also gets together for an hour and a half of ‘fun’ football at Les Ormes indoor facilities. Coaching is provided by voluntary qualified coaches with the assistance of some students who have also gained valuable experience towards careers in welfare and medicine.</p>'
